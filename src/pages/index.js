      <h1>Dealing with Online Harassment & Bullying</h1>
      <p>Online harassment can take many forms, including:

- Cyberbullying, Trolling, Flaming, Doxing, Outing, Fraping

Regardless of the method, perpetrators use personal information, abusive messaging, or bullying behavior to cause emotional distress. Social media is typically the platform of choice for these activities, with perpetrators often hiding behind fake or hacked profiles to target victims.</p>
      
      <p>If you don’t feel safe and the harassment has been persistent, you may be a victim of cyber stalking.

      <h3>Online Harassment & Bullying in India - Do This First!</h3>
      
      <p>When experiencing online harassment in India, it’s essential to take immediate action. Here are the crucial steps to follow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Document Everything </b> - Keep a record of all instances of online harassment. Take screenshots or print the pages. Capture both the messages and the profile pages from which the abuse originates. This documentation will serve as useful evidence for the police or social media platforms if the harassment escalates. It also ensures you have a copy if the perpetrator deletes their posts and profile.</li>
        <li><b> Report it to the Police </b> - The police take online harassment reports seriously and have extensive experience investigating them. Report the abuse early to the police either directly or through a report service such as [Report-it India](https://www.report-it.org.india/home). If you feel there is any immediate threat to your personal safety, dial 100.</li>
        <li><b> Focus on Your Online Security</b> - As the perpetrator collects more information about you, they may try to gain access to your accounts such as social media and email. Ensure you have strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication. For more advice, visit [Get Safe Online](https://www.getsafeonline.org/). Review what personal information exists about you online and try to remove as much as possible. For example, Google yourself to see if your address, phone number, or places you regularly spend time are publicly available.</li>
        <li><b> Remember It Is Not Your Fault</b> - Perpetrators of online abuse can be people you know or complete strangers. These individuals often have emotional and mental health issues that drive them to cause distress. It is not your fault. Speak to someone close to you about the abuse and contact a specialist victim support charity if you need expert emotional support. 
        For further assistance and support in India, you can refer to these guidelines and seek help from relevant authorities and support organizations.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Approaches to Dealing with Online Harassment in India</h1>
      <p>While there are general guidelines for dealing with online harassment, each case is unique. Try the following steps and monitor progress over time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Try Not to Engage</strong> - Perpetrators of online abuse seek a reaction and want to see evidence they are causing harm. Don't engage or get into fights online. Simply ignoring the comments may lead the perpetrator to move on to another target.</li>
        <li><strong> Avoid Deleting Content Unless It Includes Personal or Sensitive Information  </strong> - Deleting comments shows they have been read and often prompts the abuser to post more frequently and with more harmful content. Others who read the comments will recognize them for what they are and ignore them. However, if comments include personal information (such as contact details) or sensitive images that you don't want online, delete them immediately.</li>
        <li><strong> Report the Abuse to the Social Media or Communication Platform</strong> - Most social media and communication platforms now have mechanisms to report online abuse. Each platform has its own process, but all take abuse seriously and will help you resolve the issue. If the platform's response is inadequate, report it to [Report Harmful Content](https://reportharmfulcontent.com/), which will offer additional support.</li>
        <li><strong> Block the Offending Accounts </strong> -  If the perpetrator is persistent, block the social media, email, and instant messaging accounts used. If the perpetrator creates new profiles and continues the abuse, report and block them again.</li>
        <li><strong>  If You Feel the Need to Respond, Stick to the Facts</strong> -  Avoid getting emotional or engaging in an online argument. State your case with facts and move on.
        For further assistance and support in India, follow these guidelines and seek help from relevant authorities and support organizations.</li>
       
      </ul>

      <h3> If You Are Being Bullied </h3>
      <ul>
      
      <li><strong> Know It Is Not Your Fault </strong>:- Nobody deserves to be bullied. When someone is repeatedly cruel to you, it’s due to their own personal issues. Remember, it’s not your fault.</li>
      <li><strong>Reach Out for Help</strong>:- If the bullying is really affecting you, seek help. You deserve support. Find someone who can listen and help you process what's happening – a friend, relative, or an adult you trust.</li>
      <li><strong> Don’t Respond or Retaliate </strong>:- Bullies often seek a reaction because it gives them a sense of power. Responding or retaliating can escalate the situation and turn you into a bully as well. If possible, remove yourself from the situation. Sometimes, using humor can disarm or distract the bully.</li>
      <li><strong> Tell the Person to Stop </strong>:- Only do this if you feel comfortable and confident. Make it clear that you won’t tolerate the treatment anymore. Practicing with someone you trust, like a parent or good friend, can help.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Available Tools </strong>:- Most social media platforms allow you to block the person. Whether the bullying occurs in an app, through texting, or in comments or tagged photos, block the person and report the problem to the service. While this might not end the bullying, it reduces exposure and temptation to respond.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Bullying: Advice for Parents & Carers</h3>
      <p>Each case of cyberbullying is unique and should be taken seriously. Here’s some advice for parents and carers:</p>
          <li><strong> Let Them Talk </strong> - Allow your child to share their experiences in their own way. Listen without interrupting. Prompt if necessary, but let them do most of the talking. Avoid making them feel embarrassed or ashamed for seeking help</li>
          <li><strong> Don’t Deny Access to Technology  </strong> -  Young people often fear that their devices will be taken away if they report online bullying. Reassure them that this won’t happen if they speak up about their concerns.</li>
          <li><strong> Talk to Their School </strong> -  Schools play a vital role in addressing abusive online behavior. They have policies and tools, such as the Enable anti-bullying toolkit, to provide care for all students. Discuss the evidence of bullying with your child and consider speaking to the school together.</li>
          <li><strong> Contact the Police If You Fear for Their Safety </strong> - If your child is in immediate danger, don’t hesitate to call the police. If there is a direct threat of violence or harm, contact your local police for support.</li>
